# 2026-Mar__Microservices-architecture

## Plan

Migrate `speakeasy-be` from a single Express server to a monorepo of independent microservices. Each service owns its own codebase, database, and deployment unit.

---

## Monorepo structure

```
speakeasy-be/
  services/
    auth/           - JWT issuance, registration, login, password management
    user/           - user profiles, avatars, preferences
    friendship/     - friend requests, acceptance, blocking, friend lists
    tab/            - tabs, line items, cost splitting, settlements
    notification/   - push/email/SMS delivery, subscribes to async events
  gateway/          - API gateway: routing, auth validation, rate limiting
  packages/
    types/          - shared TypeScript interfaces (user IDs, event payloads)
    tsconfig/       - shared tsconfig base
```

Each service under `services/` and `gateway/` is a standalone Node.js/Express app with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, Prisma schema, and Docker service.

## Services

### 1. Auth Service

Responsible for all security concerns — intentionally kept separate from User Service.

- `POST /auth/register` — create credentials, issue JWT
- `POST /auth/login` — verify credentials, issue JWT
- `POST /auth/refresh` — rotate JWT via refresh token
- `POST /auth/logout` — invalidate refresh token

**DB:** credentials, hashed passwords, refresh tokens

---

### 2. User Service

Manages profile data. Consumes identity from Auth Service via JWT — never handles credentials directly.

- `GET /users/:id` — fetch profile
- `PATCH /users/:id` — update name, avatar, preferences

**DB:** profiles (userId, displayName, avatarUrl, preferences)

---

### 3. Friendship Service

Handles bi-directional relationships. Validates user IDs via User Service.

- `POST /friendships/request` — send friend request
- `PATCH /friendships/:id/accept` — accept request
- `PATCH /friendships/:id/reject` — reject request
- `POST /friendships/:id/block` — block a user
- `GET /friendships` — list friends

Emits async events on request/acceptance for Notification Service.

**DB:** relationships graph (userId, friendId, status, timestamps)

---

### 4. Tab Service

Core domain. Owns the tab data model entirely. Stores only user IDs — never user profile data.

- `POST /tabs` — create tab
- `POST /tabs/:id/items` — add line item
- `PATCH /tabs/:id/items/:itemId` — update item
- `POST /tabs/:id/participants` — add participant
- `POST /tabs/:id/settle` — record settlement
- `POST /tabs/:id/close` — close tab

Emits async events on tab invite and settlement for Notification Service.

**DB:** tabs, line items, participants, settlements

---

### 5. Notification Service

Delivers push/email/SMS notifications. Purely reactive — subscribes to events from other services via a message broker, never called directly by clients.

**Subscribed events:**
- `friendship.requested` → notify target user
- `friendship.accepted` → notify requester
- `tab.invite_sent` → notify invited user
- `tab.settled` → notify all participants

**Message broker:** RabbitMQ (or Kafka at higher scale)

---

### 6. API Gateway

Single entry point for all client requests. Not a domain service.

- Routes requests to the correct service
- Validates JWT on all protected routes (delegates to Auth Service or validates locally)
- Rate limiting
- Request logging

---

## Communication patterns

| Interaction | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Login / Register | Sync REST → Auth Service |
| Load profile / friends | Sync REST → User / Friendship Service |
| Create / update a tab | Sync REST → Tab Service |
| Friend request sent | Async event → Notification Service |
| Tab invite sent | Async event → Notification Service |
| Tab settled | Async event → Notification Service |

---

## Data ownership

Each service has its own database — never shared across service boundaries.

| Service | Database |
|---|---|
| Auth | credentials, refresh tokens |
| User | profiles |
| Friendship | relationships graph |
| Tab | tabs, items, participants, settlements |
| Notification | delivery log (optional) |

Cross-service data access goes through API calls or events — never direct DB access.

---

## Steps

- [ ] Step 1 — Set up monorepo tooling (`npm workspaces`, shared `tsconfig`, shared `types` package)
- [ ] Step 2 — Migrate existing Auth code into `services/auth/`
- [ ] Step 3 — Scaffold `services/user/` with User model and profile endpoints
- [ ] Step 4 — Scaffold `gateway/` with routing and JWT validation middleware
- [ ] Step 5 — Update `docker-compose.yml` to run all services and a Postgres instance per service
- [ ] Step 6 — Scaffold `services/friendship/`
- [ ] Step 7 — Scaffold `services/tab/`
- [ ] Step 8 — Add message broker (RabbitMQ) and scaffold `services/notification/`
- [ ] Step 9 — Update CI preflight to run lint + type check across all workspaces

---

## Key constraints

- Services store only user IDs — never embed profile data from another service's DB
- No shared databases between services, even temporarily
- All inter-service sync calls go through internal HTTP (not exposed via the gateway)
- The gateway is the only service exposed to the public internet
